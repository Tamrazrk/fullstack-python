* **What is a class?**

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the data and behavior that all objects of that class will have. Classes are used in object-oriented programming (OOP) to represent real-world objects and their relationships.

* **What is an instance?**

An instance is an object that is created from a class. It is a specific example of a class. Each instance has its own unique data and behavior, but it also shares the same data and behavior as all other instances of the same class.

* **What is encapsulation?**

Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the implementation details of a class from its users. This means that users only need to know about the public interface of the class, and they do not need to know how the class works internally. Encapsulation helps to make code more maintainable and reusable.

* **What is abstraction?**

Abstraction is the process of representing essential features of an object while hiding its implementation details. This allows users to focus on the what of an object, rather than the how. Abstraction helps to make code more concise and easier to understand.

* **What is inheritance?**

Inheritance is the ability of one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. This allows classes to be reused and to share code. Inheritance can also be used to create hierarchies of classes, which can be helpful for organizing code and for representing real-world relationships.

* **What is multiple inheritance?**

Multiple inheritance is the ability of a class to inherit from multiple classes. This can be useful for creating classes that have features from multiple different classes.

* **What is polymorphism?**

Polymorphism is the ability of a single function or method to behave differently depending on the type of object that it is called on. This is achieved by overloading functions or methods. Polymorphism can be used to make code more concise and to improve code readability.

* **What is method resolution order or MRO?**

Method resolution order (MRO) is the order in which a class's methods are searched when a method is called. MRO is important for multiple inheritance, as it determines which method will be called when a method with the same name is defined in multiple classes.
